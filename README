StackSet and QueueSet
These python classes are basically as their names imply. StackSet is
a LIFO data structure which maintains a set property, meaning as
duplicate elements are added, only a single copy of that element will
be contained in the set. Likewise, QueueSet is a FIFO data structure
which also maintains the properties of a set. These structures are
designed to trade space for speed. All operations happen in the fastest
way possible in amortized time.

To use these data structures, simply copy the files stackset.py and/or
queueset.py into somewhere that your PYTHONPATH can find them. Stick
them in your project directory, for all I care. You can even copy pasta
the source into your own source. The license allows it.
